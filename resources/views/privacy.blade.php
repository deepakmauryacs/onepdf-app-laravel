    </ul>

    <h5>2) Information We Collect</h5>
    <p>We collect information to operate, secure, and improve the Services and to provide you with features like secure PDF sharing and analytics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide</strong>: name, email, phone (optional), organization, billing details, addresses (for invoicing), and content you upload (PDFs/metadata, logos, watermarks, comments/labels).</li>
      <li><strong>Account & support</strong>: preferences, plan selections, tickets, and communications.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & device data</strong>: IP address, timestamps, browser/OS, device identifiers, referral URLs, pages/events, error logs, and viewer telemetry (e.g., link opens, approximate location, user agent, view duration) to power analytics and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment data</strong>: handled by our payment processors (see §6); we do not store full card details on our servers.</li>

    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.</p>

    <h5>3) OneLinkPDF’s Role</h5>
    <p>For your account data, we act as a <strong>data controller</strong>. For end-viewer events generated when you share links with third parties (e.g., when someone opens your secure PDF link), we typically act as a <strong>data processor</strong> on your behalf. You (the account owner) determine what content you upload, who can access it, and how long links remain available.</p>

    <h5>4) How We Use Information</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the Services (upload, secure-share, watermark, analytics, viewer access control, link expiry, domain/IP lock).</li>
      <li>Authenticate users, maintain accounts, and deliver subscriptions (including setup fees and renewals).</li>
      <li>Process payments and send transactional communications (receipts, notices, policy updates, security alerts).</li>
      <li>Monitor, prevent, and detect fraud, abuse, and security incidents.</li>
      <li>Improve performance, features, and UI; debug and perform analytics.</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
      <li>Where permitted, send product updates and marketing (you can opt-out anytime).</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>5) Legal Bases (GDPR)</h5>
    <p>Where GDPR applies, we rely on: performance of a contract; legitimate interests (e.g., service security, analytics to improve features); consent (where required, e.g., certain cookies/marketing); and legal obligations.</p>

    <h5>6) Payments</h5>
    <p>Payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g., <strong>Stripe</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>, and <strong>Razorpay</strong>). These processors handle your payment data per their policies:</p>

      <li><strong>With your direction</strong>: e.g., when you share links or integrate third-party tools.</li>
